# odin-recipes
In this project I will be making a simple recipes website, following a set of instructions laid by TOP's lesson and using my newly
acquired knowledge on HTML. I will be using links and images, elements and tags, and attributes as well in this project, making use
of everything I had learned so far. The final website won't look as pretty as I don't know how to style it using CSS yet, but we'll
soon get to that.
